### WHILE LOOP
*Note: It is recommended to have a quick research about `WHILE loops in BASH`.*

* a. Create a bash script that will get a `positive number` as the first argument and cover the following items:
  * Create a variable named `x` and assign a value of `1` to it.
  * Create a variable named `max` and assign it the first argument as value (like `5` if we have passed 5 as the first argument).
  * Create a **WHILE** loop with a relevant statement to print the numbers starting from `$x` (`1`) to `$max`.
