### Quoting characters and technis in BASH
*Note: It is recommended to have a quick research about the types of quotes before solving the tasks.*

Types of Quotes in BASH
* Single Quotes `'`
* Double Quotes `"`
* Back Quotes ``` ` ```
-------------------------------------

* a. Create a bash script that will cover the following items:
  * Return/Output this sentence `The price is $100.`.
  * Return/Output this sentence `'This is a long string'` (note that the surrounding single quotes should be reflected in the output).
  * Return/Output this sentence `If you run: echo $var1 shell will provide you the value.`

* b. If the previous item is done successfully, now update the same script to:
  * Create a single file named `John Smith` in `/tmp` (after running the script you may verify by running `ls -l /tmp` command, to ensure the `John Smith` file is created as a single file).

* c. If the previous item is done successfully, now update the same script to:
  * Return/Output a fixed string prefix of `Today is: ` followed by the `date` command output. For instance see the example output below:
    * `Today is: Sat Dec 24 02:42:54 +04 2022` (Note that every time that you run the script this parts output should be updated to the corresponding date and time of running the script without modifying the code).
