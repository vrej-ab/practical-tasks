### IF ELSE statements in BASH
*Note: It is recommended to have a quick research about `IF statement in BASH`.*

* a. Create a bash script that will cover the following items:
  * Check **IF** there are any arguments passed to the script **Then** provide the following outputs **Otherwise,** return/output this sentence `No arguments passed to the script` and exit the script with status/exit code of `1`:
    * Return/Output this sentence: `Script run with one or more arguments.`
    * Write a command to return/output the `number of the arguments` that are passed to the script.

* b. If the previous item is done successfully, now assuming that we will pass `single character` arguments to the script, add another IF block to the script that will:
  * Check **IF** the first argument is a `upper-case` letter **OR** it is a `lower-case` letter **Then** provide the following outputs **Otherwise,** return/output this sentence `The first argument is not an alphabet charachter` and exit the script with status/exit code of `0`:
    * Return/Output this sentence: `The first argument is a upper or lower case letter.`

* c. If the previous item is done successfully, now commentout the previous `IF` block, and add a new IF block to the script that will:
  * Check **IF** the first argument **starts** with a `upper or lower case` letter (rest of the characters are not important) **Then** provide the following outputs **Otherwise,** return/output this sentence `The first argument does not start with an alphabet charachter` and exit the script with status/exit code of `0`:
    * Return/Output this sentence: `The first argument starts with a upper or lower case letter.`
    * Return/Output the first argument's total number of character(s).
