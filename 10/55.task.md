### WHILE LOOP
*Note: It is recommended to have a quick research about `WHILE loops in BASH`.*

* a. Create a bash script (using a while loop) that will loop over the lines of a file named `example.ignoreit` available in this current directory and print each line of this file.

* b. If the previous item is done successfully, add another **WHILE** loop to the script that will:
  * Loop over the lines of the same file named `example.ignoreit` and print those lines only that starts with `upper-case` letter.
