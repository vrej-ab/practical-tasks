### FOR LOOP
*Note: It is recommended to have a quick research about `FOR loops in BASH`.*

* a. Create a bash script that will cover the following items:
  * Check **IF** there are any arguments passed to the script so proccess them as bellow **Otherwise** print `No arguments to process` message.
    * Create a **FOR** loop that will loop over the passed arguments and print/echo them to the screen/STDOUT.
    * In the same loop, check each individual argument **IF** it starts with a Alphabet character then print `Starts with a letter.` message, if this first statment doesn't matched, then add another statement (note to not use a Nested IF here but use `elif`) to check **IF** the argument starts with a Numeric character then print `Starts with a number.`, **Otherwise** print `This argument starts neither with a letter nor with a number.`.

* b. If the previous item is done successfully, add another **FOR** loop to the script that will:
  * **LOOP** over the output of the output of the `date` command and will print each element of the output (which are delimited with a space charachter by default) in a separate line. Here is an example output, assuming the `date` command output will show `Sun Dec 25 13:26:48 +04 2022` line, this part of the script should provide the following output to the user:
    * ```bash
      Sun
      Dec
      25
      13:26:48
      +04
      2022
      ```
