### IF statement comparing numbers
*Note: It is recommended to have a quick research about `IF statement comparing numbers`.*

*Note: The script in this task is intended to get two numeric arguments. Please ensure that you are using the numerical comparison statements such as `-eq` `lt` etc.*
* a. Create a bash script that will cover the following items:
  * Check **IF** the first argument is grater or equal than the second argument print a relevant message, otherwise check IF they are equal then print a relevant message, **Otherwise** print `The first argument is littler than second argument`.

* b. If the previous item is done successfully, add another IF block to the script that will:
  * Check **IF** the first argument is `NOT equal` than the second argument so print `Numbers are not equal.` message, **Otherwise** print `They are equal`.
    * Return/Output this sentence: `The first argument is a upper or lower case letter.`
