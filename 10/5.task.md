### Arrays in BASH
*Note: It is recommended to have a quick research about `How to create an array in bash` and `How to get an element of an array by the index number in BASH`.

* a. Create a bash script that will cover the following items:
  * Declare an array `myArray` and assign the following elements to it `cat` `dog` frog`.
  * Return/Output the second element `dog` by its index.
  * Return/Output all the elements at once.

* b. If the previous item is done successfully, now update the same script to:
  * Return/Output only the available indexes of the `myArray`.
