### `curl` command

* a. Write a single command to show the contant of the https://example.com to your terminl.
* b. Write a single command to show only the **Headers** of the https://example.com to your terminl.
* c. Write a single command to download the JPEG file from the following URL and save it to a file with the original filename `file_example_JPG_100kB.jpg` in the current working directory - You are not allowed to mention any filename it should be inherited from the source!
  * `https://file-examples.com/storage/fe8a7837bf63ad8783d6a5d/2017/10/file_example_JPG_100kB.jpg`

* d. Write a single command to download the JPEG file from the following URL and save it to a file named: `test.jpeg` - Do not use the BASH redirection to mention the filename, use a proper **option** instead. 
  * `https://file-examples.com/storage/fe8a7837bf63ad8783d6a5d/2017/10/file_example_JPG_100kB.jpg`

* e. Have noted that `curl` shows a progress bar each time you run it to download a file? Now add a proper **option** to the command that will silence that progress bar to be shown on the terminal.
* f. Now add a proper **option** to the command that will silence that progress bar to be shown on the terminal but will ensure to print possible errors (IF ANY) while downloading the file.
* g. If you try to run `curl http://google.com` you will get the following:
```bash
curl google.com
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>
``` 

This states that the server reports the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code). Find the **proper** option that will folow (rerun the query) for the provoded new location.

* h. Which **option** will you use to force the `curl` command operate even for insecure server connections?
