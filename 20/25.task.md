### `wget` command

* a. Write a single command to download the following file with the default name to your current working directory.
  * `https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.17.2.tar.xz`
* b. Write a single command to download the same file under different name like `linux-kernel.tar.xz`.
* c. Write a single command to download the same file with the default name but in a specific directory path other than your current working directory such as `/tmp` - this assumes that you are not in the `/tmp` directory.
* d. Write a single command to download multiple files with their links listed in `sample-jpg-links.ignoreit` file available in this directory - you are not allowed to copy and paste the links from `sample-jpg-links.ignoreit` file, pass the file directly to the command to read/use the content instead.
