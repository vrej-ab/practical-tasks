*Note: The commands in this task assumes that you're going to run them in your user's default `$HOME` directory where you have full permissions.*

* a. Write a single command to create a directory named `testdir1` (this assumes that you don't have such a directory in your current working directory).
* b. Now when you successfully created the directory, run the same command again and check the **exit code**, did you get a none zero exit code? Please explain the results.
* c. Write a single command to create two directories in the current working directories named: `dirA` and `dirB`.
* d. Write a single command to create multiple recursive directories with the following names and order:
  * `./a/b/c/d`
* e. Now please go back to the item `b.` in this task and try to do it ensuring you will get a `0` **exit code**.
