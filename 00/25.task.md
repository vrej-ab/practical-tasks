### Persistent Variables
##### What is a persistent variable?
A persistent variable is the one that is configured to be defined/available on all or an individual user's shell without need to define it every time that the user opens a shell.

* a. On your test host define a persistent variable like `pvar1` with assigned value of `A` for your user and demo it by openning a fresh shell and call that variable's value.
* b. On your test host define a persistent variable like `pvar2` with assigned value of `B` to be available for all users and demo it by openning a fresh shell (for root user or any other available user on the host) and call that variable's value.
